## Project Progress (Work in Progress)

This README is being updated as the project develops. Current progress includes:

- Set up the initial HTML structure with navigation and sections (Home, Principles, Tips, Resources).
- Linked custom CSS and Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness.
- Defined basic color variables and started layout styling in `assets/css/style.css`.

---

**Notes for future updates:**
- Add more content to each section.
- Expand CSS for improved accessibility and design.
- Document any new features or changes as they are added.
