## Recent Updates

- Card sections now display images to the right of the text for a modern, consistent look.
- Card images are sized for better alignment and visual balance.
- Added a new image to the Simple Tips card, matching the layout and style of other cards.
- Carousel images now use `object-fit: contain` and fixed height to ensure the full image is always visible.
- Section headers have extra padding and scroll margin so anchor navigation (e.g., clicking Principles) always shows the header text.
- README.md and code reviewed for accessibility, responsiveness, and clarity.
