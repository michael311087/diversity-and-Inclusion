## Project Progress (Work in Progress)

This README is being updated as the project develops. Current progress includes:

- Set up the initial HTML structure with navigation and sections (Home, Principles, Tips, Resources).
- Linked custom CSS and Bootstrap for styling and responsiveness.
- Defined basic color variables and started layout styling in `assets/css/style.css`.
- Added a hero carousel with images and captions.
- Created detailed sections for Principles, Tips, Resources, and Footer.
- Implemented custom styles for cards, lists, and headers.
- Added dark mode support with a toggle button for manual switching.
- Styled the dark mode toggle button to match navbar link colors.
- Improved active link color visibility in both light and dark mode.
- Card headers now use the site's main blue for emphasis and readability.
- Carousel captions are always white for maximum readability on all screen sizes.
- Dark mode toggle button position is fixed: it only floats on mobile/tablet, and stays inline on large screens.

**Notes for future updates:**

- Add more content to each section.
- Expand CSS for improved accessibility and design.
- Document any new features or changes as they are added.
